Many years ago, for those of you who don't remember a time when Mathematica was widely regarded as magic, Stephen Wolfram published a book called (A New Kind of Science)(https://www.wolframscience.com/). It is largely a look at the wonders of the 'computational universe' a place where the consequence of numerical laws can be 'discovered.' My physics brethren and I were pretty annoyed by this book because he went a little farther than illustrating the neat things you can do in a computational sandbox universe, and made claims that you could say everything you needed to about the real universe from the computational experiments.

I may be oversimplifying his prinicple of 'Computational Equivalence,' but it's not really the point of this post. In my current work with Data Science and trying to break into that world, I've thought a lot about how different the type of science I practiced as an experimental physicist is. In our new AI world, filled with predictive models, and deep fakes, and deep dreams, it's easy to feel like Wolfram is
